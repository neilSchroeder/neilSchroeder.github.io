I and a physicist by education and have a B.S. in Physics and a Ph.D. in High Energy Physics both from the University of Minnesota. Unfortunately, the politics of academia soured the experience for me and I decided that my time would be best spent in industry. I had many pleasant memories of working for a greenhouse after highschool and working as a landscaper in college, so I sat down to find out how I could apply the tools I had developed in graduate school to plants. The field I stumbled upon was precision agriculture and it seemed like a great fit so I set out to find a job. Luckily I had some connections at a very promising, local precision agriculture startup called Sentera. I applied and was hired as a machine learning engineer.

Outside of work/education I love to travel with my partner and our friends. We've been all over the US and Europe on some pretty fun hiking, camping, and backpacking trips out west with many more to come. I enjoy reading, mostly fiction from authors like Ursula Le Guin, N. K. Jemisin, and Brandon Sanderson, but also some non-fiction from authors like Joy Harjo and Dr. Robin Wall Kimmerer.
